                      <br>
                      The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and UK GDPR require us to explain the valid legal 
                      bases we rely on in order to process your personal information. As such, we may rely on the 
                      following legal bases to process your personal information:
                      <br>
                      <br>
                      <strong>Consent. </strong>We may process your information if you have given us permission 
                      (i.e., consent) to use your personal information for a specific purpose. You can withdraw 
                       your consent at any time.
                      <br> <br>
                      <strong>Performance of a Contract. </strong>We may process your personal information when 
                      we believe it is necessary to fulfill our contractual obligations to you, including providing 
                      our Services or at your request prior to entering into a contract with you. <br> <br>
                      <strong>Legitimate Interests. </strong> We may process your information when we believe it is
                      reasonably necessary to achieve our legitimate business interests and those interests do not 
                      outweigh your interests and fundamental rights and freedoms. For example, we may process your 
                      personal information for some of the purposes described in order to: <br> <br>
                      Send users information about special offers and discounts on our products and services <br>

                      Support our marketing activities <br>

                      Understand how our users use our products and services so we can improve user experience 
                      <br> <br>
                      <strong>Legal Obligations. </strong>We may process your information where we believe it is 
                      necessary for compliance with our legal obligations, such as to cooperate with a law enforcement 
                      body or regulatory agency, exercise or defend our legal rights, or disclose your information as 
                      evidence in litigation in which we are involved. <br> <br>
                      <strong>Vital Interests. </strong>We may process your information where we believe it is necessary
                      to protect your vital interests or the vital interests of a third party, such as situations involving
                      potential threats to the safety of any person. <br> <br>
                      In legal terms, we are generally the “data controller” under European data protection laws of the personal
                      information described in this privacy notice, since we determine the means and/or purposes of the data
                      processing we perform. This privacy notice does not apply to the personal information we process as a 
                      “data processor” on behalf of our customers. In those situations, the customer that we provide services
                      to and with whom we have entered into a data processing agreement is the “data controller” responsible 
                      for your personal information, and we merely process your information on their behalf in accordance with
                      your instructions. If you want to know more about our customers’ privacy practices, you should read their 
                      privacy policies and direct any questions you have to them. <br> <br>

                      You can withdraw your consent at any time. <br> <br>
                      In some exceptional cases, we may be legally permitted under applicable law to process your information
                      without your consent, including, for example: <br> <br>
                      If collection is clearly in the interests of an individual and consent cannot be obtained in a timely way <br>
                      For investigations and fraud detection and prevention <br>
                      For business transactions provided certain conditions are met <br>
                      If it is contained in a witness statement and the collection is necessary to assess, process, or settle an insurance claim <br>
                      For identifying injured, ill, or deceased persons and communicating with next of kin <br>
                      If we have reasonable grounds to believe an individual has been, is, or may be victim of financial abuse <br>
                      If it is reasonable to expect collection and use with consent would compromise the availability or the accuracy
                      of the information and the collection is reasonable for purposes related to investigating a breach of an agreement
                      or a contravention of the laws of Canada or a province<br>
                      If disclosure is required to comply with a subpoena, warrant, court order, or rules of the court relating to
                      the production of records <br>
                      If it was produced by an individual in the course of their employment, business, or profession and the collection
                      is consistent with the purposes for which the information was produced <br>
                      If the collection is solely for journalistic, artistic, or literary purposes <br>
                      If the information is publicly available and is specified by the regulations <br>

                        notice unless a longer retention period is required or permitted by law (such as tax, accounting, or other legal 
                        requirements). No purpose in this notice will require us to keep your personal information for longer than [time 
                        period]. <br> <br>
                        When we have no ongoing legitimate business need to process your personal information, we will either delete or 
                        anonymize such information or, if this is not possible (for example, because your personal information has been 
                        stored in backup archives), then we will securely store your personal information and isolate it from any further 
                        processing until deletion is possible. <br> <br>

                    <p class="p-text">
                        In Short: We aim to protect your personal information through a system of organizational and technical security measures.
                        <br> <br>
                        We have implemented appropriate technical and organizational security measures designed to protect the security of any 
                        personal information we process. However, please also remember that we cannot guarantee that the internet itself is 100% 
                        secure. Although we will do our best to protect your personal information, the transmission of personal information to and 
                        from our Services is at your own risk. You should only access the Services within a secure environment. <br> <br>

                        In Short: We do not knowingly collect data from or market to children under 18 years of age. <br> <br>
                        We do not knowingly solicit data from or market to children under 18 years of age. By using the Services, you represent 
                        that you are at least 18 or that you are the parent or guardian of such a minor and consent to such minor dependent’s 
                        use of the Services. If we learn that personal information from users less than 18 years of age has been collected, we 
                        will deactivate the account and take reasonable measures to promptly delete such data from our records. If you become

                    access to and control over your personal information. You may review, 
                    change, or terminate your account at any time. <br> <br>
                    In some regions (like the EEA, UK, and Canada), you have certain rights 
                    under applicable data protection laws. These may include the right (i) 
                    to request access and obtain a copy of your personal information, (ii) 
                    to request rectification or erasure; (iii) to restrict the processing

                    We will consider and act upon any request in accordance with applicable
                    data protection laws. <br> <br>

                    Withdrawing your consent: If we are relying on your consent to process your personal 
                    information, which may be express and/or implied consent depending on the applicable 
                    law, you have the right to withdraw your consent at any time. You can withdraw your

                    However, please note that this will not affect the lawfulness of the processing before 
                    its withdrawal, nor when applicable law allows, will it affect the processing of your 
                    personal information conducted in reliance on lawful processing grounds other than 
                    consent. <br> <br>

                    <p class="p-text">
                        Most web browsers and some mobile operating systems and mobile applications
                        include a Do-Not-Track (“DNT”) feature or setting you can activate to signal 
                        your privacy preference not to have data about your online browsing activities 
                        monitored and collected. No uniform technology standard for recognizing and 
                        implementing DNT signals has been finalized. As such, we do not currently 
                        respond to DNT browser signals or any other mechanism that automatically 
                        communicates your choice not to be tracked online. If a standard for online 
                        tracking is adopted that we must follow in the future, we will inform you
